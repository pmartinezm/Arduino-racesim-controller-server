# Arduino-racesim-controller-server

## Client
The client is an arduino with a simple sketch and circuit: [Go to repo](https://github.com/pmartinezm/Arduino-racesim-controller-client).

## Running server
You have to build an executable jar file and run it via cmd:
`cd ARCS.jar_path`
`java -jar ARCS.jar`
It will be easier in future versions. Sorry for the inconvenience.
