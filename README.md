# Arduino-racesim-controller-server

## Client
The client is an arduino with a simple sketch and circuit: [Go to repo](https://github.com/pmartinezm/Arduino-racesim-controller-client).

## Running server
You have to build an executable jar file and run it via cmd:
`cd ARCS.jar_path`
`java -jar ARCS.jar`
It will be easier in future versions. Sorry for the inconvenience.

## Know bugs / issues
Tested tested as handbrake in Assetto Corsa (handbrake binded to SPACE key).
Sometimes server goes crazy. The HB stops working and randomly brakes and releases. To fix that please restart the server.
